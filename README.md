# Test Task Of Creating Simple ETL CLI Project
## Number of rows in my table after running the program: 29840
- Total number of rows: 30000
- 49 rows coudn't be parsed;
- 111 rows removed as dublicates;

##Notes:
- This is a simple test task, and I didnâ€™t strictly adhere to SOLID principles. I used static members throughout my program for simplicity;
- All connection strings and file paths are hardcoded for simplicity;
- This app uses LocalDB MS SQL Server; to use any other database, change the connection string;
- If you encounter any issues running this app, make sure that all .csv and .sql files are copied into the build directory;

## Thank you for your attention!
